# Privacy Policy

**Last updated: August 11, 2025**

TripSafe (“we,” “our,” or “us”) is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how our mobile application (the “App”) works with your data.

---

## 1. Scope & Key Principle

**Local-Only Data Storage.** TripSafe stores **all** user data locally on your device. We do **not** operate cloud databases for your content and we do **not** have access to your documents, itineraries, notes, or checklists.

What this means:
- **Your data stays on your device.** We cannot see or access it.  
- **No cloud storage.** Nothing is uploaded to TripSafe servers.  
- **No tracking/analytics.** We do not monitor your behavior.  
- **You’re in control.** Add, edit, export, and delete on your device.

> Note: Some limited data may be processed by platform services you choose to use (e.g., app stores for purchases, weather provider for destination weather). See **Section 7**.

---

## 2. What We Collect

### 2.1 From App Usage
- **Nothing.** We do not collect names, emails, documents, trips, usage analytics, or identifiers from your in-app activity.

### 2.2 You May Choose to Share
- **Premium subscription status** (known to us only via app stores / subscription provider).  
- **Support emails** you voluntarily send us.  
- **App store reviews** you choose to post.

---

## 3. Security & On-Device Protection

### 3.1 Encryption & Architecture
- **AES-256 at rest** for stored data.
- **Zero-knowledge design:** we do not possess your keys or content.
- **Secure key storage:** keys derived/stored using OS-level secure hardware where available (e.g., Secure Enclave/StrongBox).
- **Transport security:** When the App makes network calls (e.g., to weather API), requests use HTTPS.

### 3.2 Access Controls
- **Biometric lock (optional):** Face ID / Touch ID.  
- **PIN / passcode (optional).**  
- **Tamper awareness:** the app may restrict access after repeated failures.

> Backups: Device-level backups (e.g., iCloud/Google) are controlled by you and governed by Apple/Google policies.

---

## 4. App Permissions (Optional, User-Controlled)

- **Camera:** only when you capture document photos.  
- **Photos/Media:** only when you import images you select.  
- **Notifications:** only for reminders you configure.  
- **Calendar:** only if you opt to sync trip dates.  
- **Location/Weather:** only if you enable weather features; the app sends **destination coordinates** to the weather provider, not your live location.  
- **Biometrics:** used locally for access control.

---

## 5. Your Rights & Controls

Because we don’t collect your in-app data:
- **Access/Export:** Access and export directly from your device.  
- **Delete:** Delete items or uninstall the App to remove local data.  
- **No profiling/tracking:** We do not create profiles or track you across apps.  

If you email us, you can request deletion of that correspondence at any time.

---

## 6. Data Management On Your Device

### 6.1 Stored Locally
- Trips (destinations, dates, itineraries), documents (photos/PDFs), checklists, notes, preferences, and security settings.

### 6.2 Backup & Restore
- Use your device’s native backup (e.g., iCloud/Google).  
- We cannot recover data if you lose the device and have no backup.

### 6.3 Cross-Device Sync
- TripSafe does not sync via our servers. Use your OS backup/restore to move data to a new device.

---

## 7. Third-Party Services (Limited, Opt-In)

We aim to avoid third-party data flows. However, to provide core functionality:

- **App Stores (Apple/Google):** distribution, purchase validation, subscription status.  
- **Subscription Provider (e.g., RevenueCat):** validates purchases and entitlements. Limited purchase metadata may be processed by that provider and the app stores.  
- **Weather Provider (e.g., Open-Meteo):** if enabled, we send **destination coordinates** to retrieve forecasts. We do **not** send your personal identifiers.

We do **not** use:
- Advertising networks, social media SDKs, or behavioral analytics SDKs.  
- Cloud storage operated by TripSafe.

Please review the privacy policies of Apple, Google, your chosen subscription provider, and the weather API for their independent practices.

---

## 8. Information Sharing

We do **not** sell, rent, or share your content. We may disclose limited information only:
- **Legal/regulatory:** if required by law or valid legal process.  
- **Security/fraud:** to protect users, our rights, or the integrity of the App.  
- **With your explicit consent.**

---

## 9. Children’s Privacy

- The App is usable by individuals **13+**.  
- We do not knowingly collect personal data from children.  
- Because data remains on-device, parents/guardians control what a child stores.

---

## 10. International Considerations

- TripSafe does not transfer your in-app data to TripSafe servers.  
- Platform services you use (e.g., app stores, subscription validation, weather API) may process limited data under their own jurisdictions and safeguards.

---

## 11. Security Standards & Statements

We align our engineering practices with widely recognized security guidance (e.g., OWASP Mobile, NIST CSF) and modern encryption standards.  
**We do not claim formal certifications (e.g., SOC 2, ISO 27001) unless explicitly stated in this repository.**

If you hold such certifications and want them listed here, let us know and we’ll update this section accordingly.

---

## 12. Data Incidents

Because we do not host your in-app content, a breach of TripSafe servers would not expose your on-device data. If a third-party provider we rely on experiences an incident relevant to TripSafe functionality, we will follow applicable notice obligations and surface practical guidance in-app or via release notes.

---

## 13. Changes to This Policy

- We may update this policy as the App evolves.  
- Material changes will be communicated in release notes and/or in-app.  
- Continued use after changes indicates acceptance.

---

## 14. Contact

- **Privacy & Data Questions:** benjaminliamharris@gmail.com  
- **Typical response time:** within 48 hours

If you request “my data”: since we don’t host your in-app data, there is nothing for us to export from our side. For purchase/receipt data, please contact your app store or subscription provider.

---

**Summary:** TripSafe uses a local-first, zero-knowledge approach. Your travel data stays on your device, protected with strong encryption and OS-level security. We don’t collect analytics, we don’t run ads, and we don’t host your content.
